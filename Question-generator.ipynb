       "'1. The Lost Child\\nA child goes to a fair with his parents. He is happy\\nand excited and wants the sweets and toys\\ndisplayed there. But his parents don’t buy them for\\nhim. Why then does he refuse when someone else\\noffers them to him?\\nIT was the festival of spring. From the wintry shades of narrow\\nlanes and alleys emerged a gaily clad humanity. Some walked,\\nsome rode on horses, others sat, being carried in bamboo and\\nbullock carts. One little boy ran between his father’s legs,\\nbrimming over with life and laughter.\\nRationalised 2023-24“Come, child, come,” called his parents, as he lagged behind,\\nfascinated by the toys in the shops that lined the way.\\nHe hurried towards his parents, his feet obedient to their call,\\nhis eyes still lingering on the receding toys. As he came to where\\nthey had stopped to wait for him, he could not suppress the desire\\nof his heart, even though he well knew the old, cold stare of refusal\\nin their eyes.\\n“I want that toy,” he pleaded.\\nHis father looked at him red-eyed, in his familiar tyrant’s way.\\nHis mother, melted by the free spirit of the day was tender and,\\ngiving him her finger to hold, said, “Look, child, what is before you!”\\nIt was a flowering mustard-field, pale like melting gold as it\\nswept across miles and miles of even land.\\nA group of dragon-flies were bustling about on their gaudy\\npurple wings, intercepting the flight of a lone black bee or butterfly\\nin search of sweetness from the flowers. The child followed them\\nin the air with his gaze, till one of them would still its wings and\\nrest, and he would try to catch it. But it would go fluttering,\\nflapping, up into the air, when he had almost caught it in his\\nhands. Then his mother gave a cautionary call: “Come, child,\\ncome, come on to the footpath.”\\nHe ran towards his parents gaily and walked abreast of them\\nfor a while, being, however, soon left behind, attracted by the\\nlittle insects and worms along the footpath that were teeming out\\nfrom their hiding places to enjoy the sunshine.\\n“Come, child, come!” his parents called from the shade of a\\ngrove where they had seated themselves on the edge of a well. He\\nran towards them.\\nA shower of young flowers fell upon the child as he entered\\nthe grove, and, forgetting his parents, he began to gather the\\nraining petals in his hands. But lo! he heard the cooing of doves\\nand ran towards his parents, shouting, “The dove! The dove!” The\\nraining petals dropped from his forgotten hands.\\n“Come, child, come!” they called to the child, who had now\\ngone running in wild capers round the banyan tree, and gathering\\nhim up they took the narrow, winding footpath which led to the\\nfair through the mustard fields.\\n2 / Moments\\nRationalised 2023-24As they neared the village the child could see many other\\nfootpaths full of throngs, converging to the whirlpool of the fair,\\nand felt at once repelled and fascinated by the confusion of the\\nworld he was entering.\\nA sweetmeat seller hawked, “gulab-jaman, rasagulla, burfi,\\njalebi,” at the corner of the entrance and a crowd pressed round\\nhis counter at the foot of an architecture of many coloured sweets,\\ndecorated with leaves of silver and gold. The child stared open-\\neyed and his mouth watered for the burfi that was his favourite\\nsweet. “I want that burfi,” he slowly murmured. But he half knew\\nas he begged that his plea would not be heeded because his\\nparents would say he was greedy. So without waiting for an answer\\nhe moved on.\\nA flower-seller hawked, “A garland of gulmohur, a garland of\\ngulmohur!” The child seemed irresistibly drawn. He went towards\\nthe basket where the flowers lay heaped and half murmured, “I\\nwant that garland.” But he well knew his parents would refuse to\\nbuy him those flowers because they would say that they were\\ncheap. So, without waiting for an answer, he moved on.\\nA man stood holding a pole with yellow, red, green and purple\\nballoons flying from it. The child was simply carried away by the\\nrainbow glory of their silken colours and he was filled with an\\noverwhelming desire to possess them all. But he well knew his\\nparents would never buy him the balloons because they would\\nsay he was too old to play with such toys. So he walked on farther.\\nA snake-charmer stood playing a flute to a snake which coiled\\nitself in a basket, its head raised in a graceful bend like the neck\\nof a swan, while the music stole into its invisible ears like the\\ngentle rippling of an invisible waterfall. The child went towards\\nthe snake-charmer. But, knowing his parents had forbidden him\\nto hear such coarse music as the snake-charmer played, he\\nproceeded farther.\\nThere was a roundabout in full swing. Men, women and\\nchildren, carried away in a whirling motion, shrieked and cried\\nwith dizzy laughter. The child watched them intently and then he\\nmade a bold request: “I want to go on the roundabout, please,\\nFather, Mother.”\\nThe Lost Child / 3\\nRationalised 2023-24There was no reply. He turned to look at his parents. They were\\nnot there, ahead of him. He turned to look on either side. They\\nwere not there. He looked behind. There was no sign of them.\\nA full, deep cry rose within his dry throat and with a sudden\\njerk of his body he ran from where he stood, crying in real fear,\\n“Mother, Father.” Tears rolled down from his eyes, hot and fierce;\\nhis flushed face was convulsed with fear. Panic-stricken, he ran\\nto one side first, then to the other, hither and thither in all\\ndirections, knowing not where to go. “Mother, Father,” he wailed.\\nHis yellow turban came untied and his clothes became muddy.\\nHaving run to and fro in a rage of running for a while, he\\nstood defeated, his cries suppressed into sobs. At little distances\\non the green grass he could see, through his filmy eyes, men and\\nwomen talking. He tried to look intently among the patches of\\nbright yellow clothes, but there was no sign of his father and\\nmother among these people, who seemed to laugh and talk just\\nfor the sake of laughing and talking.\\nHe ran quickly again, this time to a shrine to which people\\nseemed to be crowding. Every little inch of space here was\\ncongested with men, but he ran through people’s legs, his little\\nsob lingering: “Mother, Father!” Near the entrance to the temple,\\nhowever, the crowd became very thick: men jostled each other,\\nheavy men, with flashing, murderous eyes and hefty shoulders.\\nThe poor child struggled to thrust a way between their feet but,\\nknocked to and fro by their brutal movements, he might have\\nbeen trampled underfoot, had he not shrieked at the highest\\npitch of his voice, “Father, Mother!” A man in the surging crowd\\nheard his cry and, stooping with great difficulty, lifted him up\\nin his arms.\\n“How did you get here, child? Whose baby are you?” the man\\nasked as he steered clear of the mass. The child wept more\\nbitterly than ever now and only cried, “I want my mother, I\\nwant my father!”\\nThe man tried to soothe him by taking him to the roundabout.\\n“Will you have a ride on the horse?” he gently asked as he\\napproached the ring. The child’s throat tore into a thousand shrill\\nsobs and he only shouted, “I want my mother, I want my father!”\\n4 / Moments\\nRationalised 2023-24The man headed towards the place where the snake-charmer\\nstill played on the flute to the swaying cobra. “Listen to that\\nnice music, child!” he pleaded. But the child shut his ears with\\nhis fingers and shouted his double-pitched strain: “I want my\\nmother, I want my father!” The man took him near the balloons,\\nthinking the bright colours of the balloons would distract the\\nchild’s attention and quieten him. “Would you like a rainbow-\\ncoloured balloon?” he persuasively asked. The child turned his\\neyes from the flying balloons and just sobbed, “I want my mother,\\nI want my father!”\\nThe man, still trying to make the child happy, bore him to the\\ngate where the flower-seller sat. “Look! Can you smell those nice\\nflowers, child! Would you like a garland to put round your neck?”\\nThe Lost Child / 5\\nRationalised 2023-24The child turned his nose away from the basket and reiterated\\nhis sob, “I want my mother, I want my father!”\\nThinking to humour his disconsolate charge by a gift of\\nsweets, the man took him to the counter of the sweet shop.\\n“What sweets would you like, child?” he asked. The child turned\\nhis face from the sweet shop and only sobbed, “I want my\\nmother, I want my father!”\\nMULK RAJ ANAND\\nTTTTTHHHHHIIIIINNNNNKKKKK AAAAA BBBBBOOOOOUUUUUTTTTT IIIII TTTTT\\n1.
